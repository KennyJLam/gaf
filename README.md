Latest Stable Version
=====================

The source here is the latest stable version and reflects the version that is published in [Nuget.org](http://nuget.org/packages/gaf).

Description
===========

The Genetic Algorithm Framework (GAF) is designed to be the simplest way to implement a genetic algorithm in C#. The GAF is a .Net/Mono assembly, freely available via NuGet, that allows a genetic algorithm based solution to be implemented in C# using only a few lines of code.

For a full explanation of what a genetic algorithm is, and what it can do, please see the post Understanding Genetic Algorithms in less than 10 minutes and John Newcombe's article Implementing Genetic Algorithms in C# on Code Project.

The GAF has been designed to be as generic and extensible as possible whilst at the same time being simple to use. The single assembly contains all that is needed for many combinations of genetic algorithm. Many popular genetic operators are provided within the GAF, in addition, external operators can be defined and added to the GA process pipeline as required by the consumer.

To get started, simply install the GAF using the NuGet Package Manager. Execute the following command at the Package Manager Console.

`PM> Install-Package GAF`
